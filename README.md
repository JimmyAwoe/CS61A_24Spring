This repository is created to record my study of 24 spring CS61a.

CS61a is a course from UC Berkeley teached by John DeNero based on an adaptation
of the famous SCIP. This course is also mainly focus on the abstract of
programming on while at the same time, python, scheme and sql, three languages,
will be teached among the course.

I have finished all 12 labs, 10 homeworks and 4 projects independly which had
been committed in my repository.

Course vedios are also an important part of CS61a. I watched them in Bilibili
where bilingual subtitles are given.

For textbook, one can find them either in https://composingprograms.netlify.app
for Chinese version or https://www.composingprograms.com for English version.
The textbook contains a great amount of exampltes to explain the bottom of
python language mechanism.

I also summarize what I've gained from the course briefly in view.txt. If you
hesitate to take this course and wondering what this course include, I recommand
you to have a quick look by

```bash
cat view.txt
```

or you can edit it by vim,

```bash
vim view.txt
```

**I'm truly grateful to the professor John DeNero and the UC, Berkeley for
making the course videos and all the materials publicly available. I've
benefited a great deal from them.**

There is another website I highly recommand everyone who want to study the
computer science to open. That is https://csdiy.wiki/, which listed a great
amount good online courses available.

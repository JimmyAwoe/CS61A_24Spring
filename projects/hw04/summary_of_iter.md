# Defination 
- *Iterable* In general, an iterable is an object on which calling the built-in iter function returns an iterator. 
- *Iterator* An iterator is an object on which calling the built-in next function returns the next value.
- *Generator* A generator is an iterator that is returned by calling a generator function, which is a function that contains yield statements instead of return statements.

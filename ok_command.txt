ok commands
=============

Test
-----
To test a specific question, use the -q option with the name of the question:
* python3 ok -q ### Q1

You can run all the tests with the following command:
* python3 ok

By default, only tests that fail will appear. If you want to see how you did on all tests, you can use the -v option:
* python3 ok -v

Test locally
* python3 ok --local


To start the interactive interpreter automatically upon failing an ok test:
* python3 ok -q 01 -i

You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing
* print("DEBUG:", x) 
which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail with extra output.
